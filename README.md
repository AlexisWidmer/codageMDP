The program is already maked. To clear the directory, use the command "make clean" in the top of the directory.

To make all files needed to launch the program, use "make all".

To execute the program (Dynamic program in the "build/" directory), use "make execution" after the "make all".


Thanks to put my name "Lesys" on files if you are sharing this.

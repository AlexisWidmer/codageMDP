This program is for crypting messages with a key word. For my own, I'm using it for all my passwords, making them crypted with my key word and an other word picked up. I just need to remember my random picked up word to know what is my password.


The program is already maked. To clear files created by make in the directory, use the command "make clean" in the top of the directory.

To make all files needed to launch the program, use "make all".

To execute the program (Dynamic program in the "build/" directory), use "make execution" after the "make all".

If you want, a static one is usable in "build/" directory, named "mdp.static".


Indications are in english but the commentaries are in french. I'm going to see if I can translate it.


Thanks for using my app and please, don't forget to put my nickname "Lesys" on files if you are sharing this.

Forgive me for this english, I'm not used to write help in english but I'm increasing this !
At the next time!
